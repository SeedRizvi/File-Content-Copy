# File-Content-Copy
Copies contents of files from a directory to a single .txt (or csv) file. Edit initial lines of code to fill out the necessary details:
- Location of files to read from
- Filetype of files to read
- Location of file to write to

*NOTE* All locations can be relative to .exe location OR absolute e.g. "C:/Users/user_name/Desktop/".

Future changes:
- Remove need for elimination string (extra unnecessary parameter)
- Remove need for outputFile name, this can be extracted from info of file to write to
